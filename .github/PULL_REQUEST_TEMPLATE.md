# üö™ GESTURE GATE VALIDATION

> **Required for ALL Pull Requests affecting user interaction**

## ‚úÖ **CORE REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST**

### **Gesture Integration** (ALL must pass for CORE features)
- [ ] **Native Gesture Access**: Primary operation accessible via gesture pattern
- [ ] **‚â§100ms Response Time**: Measured timing: ___ms (provide actual measurement)
- [ ] **Universal Context**: Tested on desktop + touch + accessibility
- [ ] **Pattern Consistency**: Uses existing gesture language (no new patterns)
- [ ] **Trinity Integration**: Zero conflicts with drag/nested/tree verified
- [ ] **No-Mouse Independence**: Functions without mouse or keyboard shortcuts

### **Performance Measurements** (Required)
- **Desktop Long-press Response**: ___ms
- **Touch Long-press Response**: ___ms  
- **Desktop Double-tap Response**: ___ms
- **Touch Double-tap Response**: ___ms
- **Drag Initiation Time**: ___ms
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå

### **Testing Evidence** (Required)
- [ ] **Desktop Demo**: Video/GIF of gesture interaction attached
- [ ] **Touch Demo**: Video/GIF of touch gesture attached  
- [ ] **Performance Test Results**: Automated test output included
- [ ] **Trinity Conflict Test**: Verified no interference with core systems

## üéØ **FEATURE CLASSIFICATION**

Based on Gesture Gate validation:

- [ ] **CORE ATELIER** (all requirements met - can be part of core system)
- [ ] **UTILITY** (some core missing - remains enhancement/utility)  
- [ ] **REJECTED** (major violations - requires rework)

**If not CORE ATELIER, explain why and roadmap to fix:**

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Gesture Patterns Used**
- [ ] Long-press (AI context activation)
- [ ] Double-tap (radial menu)
- [ ] Drag & Drop (movement/nesting)
- [ ] Tap (selection/navigation)
- [ ] Swipe (directional operations)
- [ ] Custom: ___ (justify new pattern)

### **Integration Points**
- **Trinity Systems Affected**: 
  - [ ] Drag System
  - [ ] Nested Boards
  - [ ] TreeView
  - [ ] None (isolated feature)

- **Performance Impact**:
  - Baseline drag performance: ‚úÖ Maintained / ‚ùå Degraded
  - Memory usage: ‚úÖ Stable / ‚ùå Increased
  - Rendering performance: ‚úÖ Stable / ‚ùå Degraded

## üìä **VALIDATION RESULTS**

### **Automated Test Results**
```bash
# Paste output of: npm run test:gesture-performance
```

### **Manual Testing Results**
- **Platforms Tested**: 
  - [ ] Chrome Desktop
  - [ ] Safari Desktop  
  - [ ] Chrome Mobile
  - [ ] Safari Mobile
  - [ ] Touch Laptop

- **Contexts Tested**:
  - [ ] Canvas interaction
  - [ ] Board navigation
  - [ ] Tree operations
  - [ ] Menu systems

## üõ°Ô∏è **BASELINE PROTECTION**

### **No Regressions Verified**
- [ ] Existing gesture patterns unchanged
- [ ] No performance degradation in Trinity systems
- [ ] No conflicts with established UX patterns
- [ ] Cross-platform behavior consistent

### **Error Handling**
- [ ] Graceful failure when gesture not recognized
- [ ] Fallback interactions available
- [ ] No crashes or frozen states
- [ ] Clear user feedback for failed gestures
