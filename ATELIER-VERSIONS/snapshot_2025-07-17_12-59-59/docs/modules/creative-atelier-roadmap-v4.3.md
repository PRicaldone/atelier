# Creative Atelier Roadmap v4.3 - Templates & Export Evolution
**Foundation Enhancement for Advanced Creative Workflows**

## 🎯 **Module Vision v4.3**

**Evolution Goal**: From stable foundation → **Template-Driven Export Powerhouse**

**Strategic Position**: Creative Atelier becomes the **output and organization layer** for Mind Garden's conversational intelligence, with powerful templates and export capabilities.

## 🏗️ **CURRENT STATUS v4.2**

### **✅ Stable Foundation Achievements**
```javascript
const CanvasV42Status = {
  coreFeatures: {
    dragDropSystem: "✅ Multi-type elements (note, image, link, AI, board)",
    navigation: "✅ Pan (Alt+drag), Zoom (right-click+drag), Tree View",
    persistence: "✅ Auto-save localStorage, nested boards support",
    shortcuts: "✅ Keyboard shortcuts, multi-select, snap-to-grid"
  },
  
  integrations: {
    mindGardenExport: "✅ Receive exports from Mind Garden conversations",
    unifiedStore: "✅ Cross-module state synchronization",
    breadcrumbNav: "✅ Nested board navigation working"
  },
  
  userExperience: {
    adaptiveNotes: "✅ Title + content editing like Mind Garden",
    visualConsistency: "✅ UI patterns coherent across modules",
    performanceOptimized: "✅ Smooth interactions, efficient rendering"
  }
}
```

### **🎯 Priority Gap Analysis**
1. **Templates Missing**: No predefined layouts or starting points
2. **Export Limited**: Basic functionality, lacks professional formats
3. **AI Integration Basic**: Suggestions system not contextual enough
4. **Collaboration Prep**: Foundation exists but no real-time features

## 🚀 **ROADMAP v4.3 - ENHANCEMENT PRIORITIES**

### **Phase 1: Template System Foundation (Priority: HIGH)**

            title: "Key Requirements",
            style: "requirements"
          }
        }
        // ... more template elements
      ]
    },
    
    metadata: {
      createdBy: "system",
      version: "1.0",
      usage: 0,
      rating: 4.8
    }
  },
  
  // TEMPLATE INSTANTIATION
  instantiateTemplate: async (templateId, customizations = {}) => {
    const template = await getTemplate(templateId);
    const instance = {
      ...template.layout,
      elements: template.layout.elements.map(element => ({
        ...element,
        id: generateUniqueId(),
        data: {
          ...element.data,
          ...customizations[element.type] || {}
        }
