# 🤌 ATELIER GESTURE REFERENCE CARD

> **"We build for hands, not just minds."**

## ⚡ **QUICK REFERENCE**

### **The Golden Rules**
1. **≤100ms response time** = WHO WE ARE
2. **Gesture is identity** = NO gesture, NO core status  
3. **Pattern invariance** = Gesture language is SACRED
4. **Universal access** = Same behavior, all platforms
5. **Trinity harmony** = Zero conflicts with drag/nested/tree

### **Core Gesture Language**
```
🤌 Long-press     → AI Context Activation
👆 Double-tap     → Radial Menu
🫳 Drag & Drop    → Movement + Nesting  
👉 Tap           → Selection + Navigation
↔️ Swipe         → Directional Operations
```

## 🚪 **GESTURE GATE CHECKLIST**

```
## GESTURE GATE CHECKLIST

- [ ] Native gesture access (long-press, double-tap, drag, etc)
- [ ] ≤100ms response time (measured, not assumed)
- [ ] Universal context (desktop + touch)
- [ ] Pattern consistency with existing gesture language
- [ ] Trinity integration (no conflicts, full harmony)
- [ ] Feature available without mouse or keyboard shortcuts

If ANY box is unchecked → Feature is NOT "core Atelier".
```

## 🚨 **INSTANT ROLLBACK TRIGGERS**

- **>100ms response** = BASELINE VIOLATION
- **New gesture patterns** = LANGUAGE BREAK  
- **Platform inconsistency** = UNIVERSAL ACCESS FAIL
- **Trinity conflicts** = HARMONY VIOLATION
- **Context failures** = IDENTITY BREAK

## 🎯 **DEVELOPER WORKFLOW**

### **Every Feature Starts With:**
*"What gesture activates, modifies, completes this?"*

### **Every PR Must Include:**
- Performance measurements (actual timings)
- Cross-platform test videos
- Gesture Gate Checklist completed
- Trinity integration verification

### **Every Review Asks:**
*"Can this be CORE without perfect gesture accessibility?"*
**Answer must be: NO**

## 💎 **PHILOSOPHY ANCHOR**

**"Every pixel, every interaction, every feature in Atelier 2.0 will honor the gesture language. Features that break this language will be rejected, regardless of their individual merit."**

**Gesture = Identity = Non-Negotiable**
