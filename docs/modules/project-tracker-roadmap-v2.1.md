# Project Tracker Roadmap v2.1 - Integration & Intelligence
**Creative Project Management with Cross-Module Workflow Integration**

## üéØ **Module Vision v2.1**

**Evolution Goal**: From basic implementation ‚Üí **Intelligent Creative Project Management Hub**

**Strategic Position**: Project Tracker becomes the **workflow orchestration layer** that connects Mind Garden exploration, Canvas organization, and deliverable management into cohesive project flows.

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS v2.0**

### **‚úÖ Basic Implementation Status**
```javascript
const ProjectTrackerV20Status = {
  coreFeatures: {
    projectListing: "‚úÖ Basic project list with names and status",
    simpleTracking: "‚úÖ Basic progress indicators and state management",
    minimalUI: "‚úÖ Clean, functional interface for project overview",
    persistence: "‚úÖ Projects saved in localStorage with basic metadata"
  },
  
  integrations: {
    unifiedStore: "‚úÖ Projects respect business context switching",
    moduleAwareness: "‚úÖ Basic awareness of other module activities",
    crossModuleData: "‚ùå No deep integration with Mind Garden/Canvas content"
  },
  
  limitations: {
    intelligentTracking: "‚ùå No automatic progress detection from other modules",
    workflowIntegration: "‚ùå No connection to Mind Garden conversations or Canvas boards", 
    deliverableManagement: "‚ùå No structured deliverable planning and tracking",
    clientCommunication: "‚ùå No client collaboration or communication features",
    aiInsights: "‚ùå No AI-powered project insights or optimization"
  }
}
```

### **üéØ Priority Gap Analysis**
1. **Integration Gap**: No meaningful connection to Mind Garden conversations or Canvas outputs
2. **Intelligence Gap**: No automatic project progress detection or AI insights
3. **Workflow Gap**: No structured creative workflow management
4. **Deliverable Gap**: No client deliverable planning and tracking system
